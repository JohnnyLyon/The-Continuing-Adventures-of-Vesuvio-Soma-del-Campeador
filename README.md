# The-Continuing-Adventures-of-Vesuvius-del-Campeador

* anger issues when young, was skinny and had volatile fire powers and glowing red skin like lava.
* because of his quick temper, often got into fights and either almost/did melt a kid for some slight
* john silver taught him to work with his hands, leading to a lifelong interest in crafting, alchemy, and so forth
* was sent to train with a powerful water kineticist on a tropical island (with a volcano)
* there learned to cool down and be more chill, focusing more on his earth powers and creating things than one destroying with fire
* Literally cooled down, in that his skin darkened to the ash black of a volcano's slope as if the lava had cooled
* vowed to rarely use his fire powers
* shielded a town from the volcano erupting by redirecting the flow and raising earth walls
* ate an [earth elemental](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=183) that he was fighting
* opened his metal gate and became more interested in crafting, alchemy, learning to tattoo and adorning himself with many tattoos and rings, earrings, and other jewelry
* wanted to join {insert school name} in order to expand his knowledge of alchemy (in order to be able to create more refined and specific elements with his powers and make cool stuff out of them

* not the sharpest tool in the shed, but devoted to understanding alchemy and crafting and is trying to be a more learned individual
* i'm currently conflicted between playing him as cartoonishly stupid which is funny) or just not that booksmart but not constantly dumb as a rock
 * i think i'll try to go for a happy medium
 * i want him to be like, a real person, and not just a caricature
 * i want him to be down to earth (pun intended)
   * he has three natures from his elements:
    * down to earth (earth)
    * scientific and calculating (metal) (i know that's might contradict the idiot part, but i think it works)
    * hot-headed and passionate (fire)
    * earth is his primary element both personality-wise and mechanics-wise
* tries hard to be calm and collected because of his violent past
* because he is pretty much magically the human embodiment of his elements (volcano man) he struggles with the emotional and personal forces imposed on him by his nature as the scion of earth, fire, and metal
* appearance:
 * ash colored skin (like a volcano), orange-red hair (maybe with a white rim around it until he gets mad?) 
 * wears harem pants with gold rings at the ankles and a sleeveless silk tunic
 * wears bangles on his arms
 * has a red letterman jacket
 * has long tattoos of rivers of lava that magically look like they're flowing down his body
 * scratch anything that contradicts with this, this looks the coolest:

### Rumors

##### True
* eats rocks
* once straight up melted someone after getting in a fight over (nothing/the kid insulted his family)
##### Kinda True
* is made of rocks (he's only made of rocks when he uses Armor in Earth but he always has the look and texture of stone
* was the captain of the national champions of {insert football-like sport here} in Murnrum, and that's how he got his letterman jacket
 * actually they were only the regional champions
##### False
* Thinks 2 + 2 = 5
* once got jumped by 8 dwarves from a rival {insert football-like sport) with knives and killed all of them with his bare hands (and his elemental powers)
 * that's what the 8 on his jacket comes from
