# The-Continuing-Adventures-of-Vesuvio-"Soma"-del-Campeador

For long before Vesuvio and his brother were born, the elemental planes have been in a constant state of tension. The only thing stoppping all out elemental war (which would be disastrous for the material plane) was the lord of the Jann, who took the mantle of the god of wishes to become the Lord of All Elements, the only individual with the sway to hold the elemental planes in check. For eons the Lord would often intervene in burgeoning wars, only to lose their life and be succeeded by one of their children, creating a long dynasty of jann Lords (and other genies who married into the family). With each successor, however, the Lord's power dwindled, such that by the time of Vesuvio's birth, the then-current lord (one of his grandparents) was only a figurehead. This was still enough to stop war until they were assassinated. The murder of a Lord of All Elements in peacetime was something that had never happened before, and it signaled two things: that war was imminent and inevitable, and that the dynasty of the jann was no longer safe. As such, Vesuvio's parents sent him and his brother far from the elemental planes, to be cared for by their distant relative and the legendary suli hero, Cid. Soon after this happened, the tower of their dynasty (located on that one mountain you told me about) was collapsed in an attack, killing them and all other known members of the lineage (leaving their bodies on that mountain). Vesuvio was raised in the Dwarven nation of Murnrum by his adoptive father Cid.

From birth Vesuvio had an awakened gate to the elemental plane of fire, which had a strong influence over his physical constitution and his personality. He glowed like lava and his skin burned to the touch, and he often underwent fits of passion and violent mood swings, causing him to end up isolated from many others (even his own father could not fully relate to Vesuvio, having always had the influence of water to balance out fire, and not being a kineticist). At many times throughout his childhood, when something or someone made him angry, he felt the urge coming from his gate to burn it or them. At a young age, Cid sent Vesuvio to serve in an apprenticeship under his old friend John Silver, who taught Vesuvio to craft magical items and tattoos, imparting his knowledge of ancient Dwarven crafting culture. He also tried to help Vesuvio's isolation in a very Dwarven way: by connecting him with his lineage. Vesuvio was eager to learn about his ancestry, as Cid never answered question on the subject (Vesuvio would not learn he was adopted until later). Even though John Silver knew nothing of Vesuvio's true heritage, he inked him an [ancestral geometry tattoo](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=2202). This had an adverse effect, however, as the tattoo would trouble the rest of Vesuvio's life with dreams and visions of unknown ancestors who would attempt to urge him to fulfill uncertain yet dangerous destinies or push malicious agendas. However, his time with John Silver did inspire in him a lifelong love of crafting. John also told Vesuvio about the god of crafting, and a legendary artisan who taught crafting at Spirithaven University, and that Vesuvio should consider attending that school if he wished to pursue crafting and tattoo artistry.

Another comfort in Vesuvio's early life was cannonball, a Dwarven sport that was created as a game with repurposed military equipment (basically just handball in real life). Vesuvio had a real talent for cannonball, and when he was in his secondary education, he quickly rose up the ranks to become captain of his school's team and led them to a regional championship victory. Cannonball was everything to him, and he neglected most everything else in his life in order to make him and his team national champions. The night before the championship match, Vesuvio was visited in a dream by a fire spirit who told him that he would meet an enemy in the match, and that he would need to use his fire to protect himself and his team. Vesuvio stepped onto the ptich the next day to find himself face to face with Rutger Stoneshoes, a kid he hated from his younger days, when the two were bitter enemies. When the time came, Vesuvio saw that his team was in danger of losing the championship that he had made the purpose of his life. Rutger on the opposing team was about to score the winning goal, and Vesuvio was too far away to block him, but he could burn him with his gate and cause him to drop the ball. Though the urge that came to him in the next moment was a supernatural one from his gate and his ancestor, he gave into it all on his own. A blast of fire incinerated Rutger and badly burned a number of other players. Vesuvio's team was disqualified and he was arrested.

With Cid intervening to save him from the harshest sentences, Vesuvio was exiled from Murnrum for his heinous crime, under punishment of life imprisonment. Hoping dearly that it would help the child, Cid arranged for Vesuvio to train under the water kineticist Milos (a distant relative) on the southern island of Suretai. For the first time in his life,Vesuvio received tutelage from a kineticist. Milos taught him to control his elements like water, and under his training, Vesuvio opened his earth gate. Deeply regretful of his actions and filled with self-hatred, Vesuvio covered his body in rock and ash and vowed never to open his fire gate again. Milos, however, sought to show Vesuvio the silver lining of his powers through the metaphor of thew volcano. In the middle of Suretai was a gigantic volcano that the locals called Soma. It was prone to violent eruptions that Milos and other kineticists would divert out of the path of the settlements. Milos taught Soma that the volcano's lava destroyed, yes, but that the ash that was left behind by the eruption was a powerful fertilizer that caused plant life to thrive on the island, and that was why people continued to live there. Thus he strove to impart to Vesuvio that each of his elements could be used for beneficial and kind purposes, and that eruptions too were part of the natural cycle of death and rebirth and were necessary, and that though they cannot be stopped, they can be controlled and redirected like a strong flow of water if one is both disciplined and flexible. With this and many years of intense training under his belt, Vesuvio became a powerful kineticist, always honing his crafting skills as well. One day, Milos had to leave the island for many weeks, and so he entrusted the volcano into Vesuvio's care, believing it would not erupt. Of course, it did. And faced with this monumental task, Vesuvio rose to the challenge and unlocked all of his gates, skillfully redirecting the flow of lava and saving the people of the island from the volcano.

After this, Vesuvio made a new vow to become a reformed man and use his powers to do good for society to atone, as much as one can, for his misdeeds, and to make an honest man of himself through his love of crafting. He took a new name, Soma, after the volcano, and inked a [memoir map tattoo](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=2210) upon his chest, choosing not to depict his previous life events but start anew. Thus a volcano appeared over his heart, itself a symbol of death and rebirth, to symbolize his rebirth as Soma. At that moment, he opened his third gate of metal. When Milos returned, he saw a changed man, and also a kineticist of fire, earth, and metal. Milos told Soma of an old legend that those kineticists who posssess those three gates (collectively called "Hell's Gate") are inheritors of incredible elemental potential, and that to achieve that potential, they must make a pilgrimage to the lair of the ancient dragon Moraes Iganiis, the first kineticist of fire who dwells in the heart of the earth, and learn the ancient secrets of the elements from him. In order to pursue that quest and continue his education, Soma then set out to enroll in Spirithaven University, hoping to find there: 1. A skilled kineticist teacher 2. the legendary artisan John Silver told him about 3. Information about Moraes Iganiis and a way to find him.

Cid remains in Murnrum to this day. Soma has always had a strained relationship with his father, and though they love each other, they aren't very close.

Upon hearing that Soma was accepted into Spirithaven University, John Silver crafted him a special magic item. One week before Soma left the island he received a parcel containing a silver, jewel-encrusted sword with a gate attenuator disk in the crossguard. The sword is crafted like a ceremonial weapon and thus unusable as a regular weapon, but amplifies Soma's kinetic powers. 

### Milos

Milos is a tall Azarketi with a sphere of water for a head. He is a master hydrokineticist who surfs the waves on his feet and leads the Brotherhood of the Waves, an organization of aquatic/semiaquatic humanoids who protect the islands of the southern seas from threats of all kinds. Although he often moves between islands, his residence is on the island of Suretai where Mt. Soma, one of the most active volcanoes in the world, lies. He has taken it upon himself to protect the village that lives on Suretai from the volcano's eruptions. He teaches other kineticists who wish to join the Brotherhood to wield their powers and deal with the monsters and other threats that arise on the islands.

He's a calm and levelheaded guy, and his relationship with the water is very deep, causing him to often teach his students with water-related metaphors. Soma remembers one instance of this from when he first arrived on the island. Milos taught him that brute force, which had previously been Soma's main tactic, would get him nowhere when the weight of the universe was against him. In Milos's own words, "swimming against the current will get you nowhere, man. All of existence has a flow; There is a direction and momentum to the way things happen. If you learn to get a sense of the flow and move accordingly, you'll find a lot more opportunities to accomplish your goal." Milos also taught Soma not to dwell on past mistakes, because it would only weigh him down. "Forgiveness is key, as the tides of time wash away all sins. The past is gone, obscured by the changing face of the sea. The only thing that matters is the waves that are coming at you now." Milos also forced Soma to survive on his own in the wilderness of the island, so he could cool down and come to app4eciate the slow things.

--------------

In his application to Spirithaven University, Soma would want to highlight his saving the people of Suretai from the volcano's eruption, and not attach himself to Cid very much. He wants to get in on his own merit, and is well aware that he has greatly benefited from Cid's money, fame, and status all of his life.
